    "text": "Spatial Point Pattern Analysis (SPPA) is the evaluation of the pattern or distribution of a set of points on a surface. The points may represent:\n\nEvents such as crimes, traffic accidents, or disease onsets, or\nBusiness services (e.g., coffee shops and fast-food outlets) or facilities such as childcare centres and eldercare centres.\n\nFirst-order Spatial Point Pattern Analysis (1st-SPPA) studies how point intensity (density) varies across space. This will help answer questions like:\n\nAre there more points in some areas than others?\nWhere are the hotspots or clusters?"
